# MFSinfoExtractor
This web (and potentially android) app parses useful information regarding your MFS transactions such as trx ID, amount, date etc from pasted or parsed text messages. Useful for charity organizations for keeping record of all their donors' contributions. The web app is being built on Django, coded in python.
